            Legacy <br>
            <p>Ada lovelac's contributions to the field of computer science were not discovered until the 1950s. Her notes were reintroduced to the world by B.V. Bowden, who republished them in faster than thought: A symposium on digital computing machines in 1953. Since then, ada has received many posthumous honors for her work. in 1980, the U.S. department of defense named a newly developed computer language "ada," after Lovelace.</p>
