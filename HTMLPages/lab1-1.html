Web pages are made up of text which is called "Marked Up", or formatted using Hyper Text Markup Language or HTML or HTML. The HTML codes, known as tags, are placed around the text that you want to format. In most cases, when formmatting text, you will have both an opening and closing tag to indicate where the formatting should start and where it should end.</p>   
    
    <p>Content on a web page is contained inside elements. There are basically two types of elements, block and incline. This content is being written inside a paragraph element, which is a block element because there will be a space above and below the paragraph essentially blocking it off from other content. 
    <strong>However this content is in a strong element which is inline. Inlin elements do not separate their content</strong>. Block elements will effect a pages layout, where inline elements will not.</p>

The elements used on this page is the HTML, which is also called the root element, the head element, bod element, heading element, paragraph element, and the strong inline element.
